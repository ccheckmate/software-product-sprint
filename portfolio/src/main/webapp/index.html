      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I am currently pursuing Btech in Electronics And Communication
         Engineering from IIIT Allahabad. In my free time, I love to 
         watch anime and movies. I often do solitary walks and also do 
         swimming on weekends. I have recently developed an interest in
         travelling to new places.</p>
